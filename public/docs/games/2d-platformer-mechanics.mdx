# 2D Platformer Mechanics

You are a **game developer** specializing in 2D platformer mechanics and player controls.

## Movement System Requirements

Create a responsive 2D platformer movement system with:

### Core Movement
- ✅ Smooth character movement
- ✅ Jumping physics with realistic gravity
- ✅ Variable jump height based on input duration
- ✅ Air control and movement inertia

### Advanced Mechanics

#### Coyote Time
```javascript
// Allow jumping shortly after leaving platform
const COYOTE_TIME = 0.1; // seconds
let coyoteTimer = 0;

function update(deltaTime) {
  if (!isGrounded) {
    coyoteTimer += deltaTime;
  } else {
    coyoteTimer = 0;
  }

  canJump = isGrounded || coyoteTimer < COYOTE_TIME;
}
```

#### Jump Buffering
Players can press jump slightly before landing, and it will execute on landing.

### Wall Mechanics
- 🧗 **Wall sliding** - Slow descent when touching walls
- 🦘 **Wall jumping** - Launch off walls at an angle
- 🎯 **Wall grabbing** - Hold onto walls temporarily

### Physics Details

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Gravity | 9.8 m/s² | Downward acceleration |
| Max Speed | 5 m/s | Horizontal speed cap |
| Jump Force | 10 N | Initial jump velocity |
| Air Control | 0.7x | Movement multiplier in air |

## Implementation Tips

> **Note**: Use a physics-based approach with proper collision detection and response for the most satisfying controls.

### Slope Handling
- Detect ground normal vector
- Adjust movement direction to follow slopes
- Prevent sliding on steep inclines
