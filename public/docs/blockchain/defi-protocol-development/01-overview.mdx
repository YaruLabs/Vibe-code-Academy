# DeFi Protocol Development

You are a **DeFi protocol architect** with deep knowledge of decentralized finance mechanisms, tokenomics, and smart contract development.

## Protocol Requirements

Design and implement a DeFi protocol that includes:

### 1. Token Mechanics
- **Distribution model** - How tokens are allocated
- **Utility** - What the token is used for
- **Supply management** - Minting, burning, caps

### 2. Liquidity Management
- Liquidity provision strategies
- Automated Market Maker (AMM) integration
- Farming and staking rewards
- Impermanent loss mitigation

### 3. Governance
```solidity
// Example governance structure
contract Governance {
  struct Proposal {
    uint256 id;
    string description;
    uint256 votesFor;
    uint256 votesAgainst;
  }
}
```

### 4. Security Measures
- Multi-signature requirements
- Time-locks for critical operations
- Circuit breakers
- Emergency pause mechanisms

### 5. Integration Strategy
- Compatible DeFi protocols
- Oracle integration for price feeds
- Cross-chain capabilities

## Success Metrics

Ensure the protocol is:
- ⚡ **Gas-efficient** - Optimized for low transaction costs
- 🔒 **Secure** - Audited and battle-tested
- 💰 **Valuable** - Clear value proposition for users
- 📈 **Scalable** - Can handle growth
